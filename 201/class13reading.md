Intro to storing user input.

## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

**Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?**

>*Storing the state of an application allows a website interface to recall where it left off with a user. Doing this on a server takes extra time to load and requires a user to log-in for them to be recognized. Local storage of user data in the browser bypasses these processes saving time and annoyance on the part of the user.*

**What information should not be stored in local storage?**

>*Sensitive information that can be exploited since this local storage is prone to hacking.*

**Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?**

>*Local storage can only store string data. Objects and numbers can be converted to strings by using a combination of the `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` methods.*

## Things I want to know more about

>*I'm guessing this is why I have to clear my history and all "cookies and other site data" so I can get the first time visitor discount prompt to show up again when I re-visit a page.*
