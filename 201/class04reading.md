# HTML Hyperlinks, CSS Layout, and JS Functions

Continuing our look into how we can apply style and function to our websites.

## HTML: Creating Hyperlinks

**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

>*`<a>`*

**The `href` attribute contains what information?**

>*the webpage url*

**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

>*Ensure text descriptions are concise and unique to each link.*

## CSS: Normal flow CSS Layout

**What is meant by “normal flow”?**

>*Normal flow is the system by which content is displayed in a default layout.*

**What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?**

>*block level elements are presented in order from top to bottom and span the width of the parent element (which may be the body). They are separated by the larger margin of the stacked elements. The margin of the smaller element is disregarded in a concept called "margin collapsing". Inline elements are presented left-to-right and are separated by both elements' margins combined. If both elements don't fit on the same horizontal line, they will wrap to the next line if able or just start on a new line if not.*

**____ positioning is the default for every html element.**

>*Static.*

**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

>*Absolutely positioned elements exist in their own layer independent of other elements. Thus, manipulating their position won't interfere with the position of others. It allows for uniques features that the user can interact with, which won't affect the rest of the page.*

**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

>*Absolutely positioned elements are positioned relative to their parent element. Fixed positioned elements are typically positioned relative to the viewport (webpage's user view) so that if a person scrolls through a pages content, the fixed position element will remain visible.*

## JS: Function - Reusable Blocks of Code

**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**  

>*To declare a function is create one. To invoke a function is to run the code the function contains.*

**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

>*A parameter is sorta like a placeholder for a value that will be used by the function later. If the function requires a parameter(s), you must provide the value for that parameter(s) at the time you call the function. The value you provide for the function is called an argument.*

## Miscellaneous - Six Reasons for Pair Programming

**Pick two benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

>*Pair programming allows developers to learn from each other, expand skillsets, and consider alternative ways to approach problem. Another benefit is accountability. Working with a partner helps both programmers stay on task with less opportunity for outside distraction.*
