# Debugging

Troubleshooting our code.

## Troubleshoorting JavaScript

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

>*Syntax errors can be thought of a typos and the program running your code simply won't understand what you're trying to say. Logic errors are like sending your partner a well-crafted apology note, but you kinda missed the point and get in more trouble. The code is capable of being processed, but you are not getting the output you intended.*

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

>*Lots of syntax errors. Sometimes the console picks them up, and displays a syntax error, which is an easy fix. ChatGPT has caught a few other syntax errors that the console missed because it was able to return null (I think). Variables being not defined has come up a bunch, either because of a syntax error or maybe because I tried to call for information that wasn't yet filled by a funciton that hadn't run yet because of the order of my code. Also, trying to load a page that links to a JS file, which referenced an ID tag on a different page broke me for awhile.. I think this was another "not defined" type of error.

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

>*Understanding error codes is crucial to identifying and fixing bugs expediently.*

## The JavaScript Debugger

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

>*The JS debugger allows you as the dev to pause and inspect what's going on as your JS runs. I imagine this is particularly powerful when variables are being created/reassigned, and when pushing into objects or arrays.*

**Define what a breakpoint is.**

>*A breakpoint is a line of code you designate to pause JS from running so you can more closely examine what's happening in your program and verify it's doing what you intend.*

**What is the call stack?**

>*The call stack displays the code that had been executed up to the line you are viewing.*

## Things I want to know more about

*The Chrome console is helpful for debugging, but I'd like to look more into these JS debugger features... I really like the idea of a breakpoints to get a better view of what is actually working or not working before I run the whole thing.*
