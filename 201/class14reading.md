# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

Using CSS to add some liveliness to our websites

## CSS Transforms

**What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**

>*The transform property allows a developer to animate an element, but is limited to the values associated with the transform property.*

**Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**

>*One way you might want to use the transform property would be to get a user's attention. A rotate transform given to a figure of a sale tag might encourage a user to click for a discount.*

## CSS Transitions & Animations

**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**

>*A transition allows the developer to animate an element in response to a change in state as described by four pesudo-classes: `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:target`.*

**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

>*A transiton animates an element in response to a change in state, but keeps that element at the same relative position on the page. An animation can allow the developer to move the element across a stage and it can respond differntly to multiple changes in state.*

**What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?**

>*Transitions engage users, and may ultimately encourage them to alter behaviour favorably for the website owner (i.e - more sales). My own personal, unprofessional opinion - it just makes a website seem more legitimate.*

**How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**

>*If you want the job, dress to impress. Good CSS is a like outfitting our public reposotories with some nice business casual.*
