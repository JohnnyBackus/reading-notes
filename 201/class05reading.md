# HTML Images, Color, Text

Adding some more style to our websites.

## HTML: Using Images

**What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?**

>*Perhaps you want search engines to find your images*

**How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**

>*By providing an alt tag description's that are useful. Concise. Avoid redundant information that is already in the main text*

**Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.**

>*This is useful when you want to connect other information to an image. A caption would be a common example.*

**Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**

>*`gif` images can be static pictures, but also really simple animations... like what your grandkid sends on your phone when they react to your text message. `svg` files can't do animation and are even simpler. They're usually just simple shapes stuck together to create something more complicated like a diagram. They're useful because they can be resize to scale easily to fit where you want them on your webpage without becoming distorted.*

**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**

>*I would choose a jpeg since I'm assuming that I don't need a very precise image and this is well supported.*

## CSS: Usign Color and Styling HTML Elements

**Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**

>*Background color is the color of the screen whereas foreground color is the color of the text.*

**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**

>*I would use the CSS properties `background color` and `color`.*

**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**

>*Readability and browser support. Using `font-family` is a good way to play if safe by providing more broadly accepted back up options of the first choice or two isn't supported.*

**What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?**

>*`font-size` sets the size of the font (either relative to the parent element or with pixels). `font-weight` allows you to adjust the boldness of a text. `font-style` allows you to apply (or turn off) italics (or oblique).*

**Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**

>*You can use the `letter-spacing` property for a lot of control over spacing or use the `font-kerning` property to disable kerning for a less significant change (they will be spaced out slightly more so that no letters don't overlap each others' space.)*

## Things I want to know more about

*Looks like CSS can offer a lot more control than I realized.*
