## Reading Questions

**What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?**

>*The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher used by Julius Caesar where letters are shifted a specified number of places. Caesar himself always used 3 (i.e. a shift of 3, would mean the letter A=D). Since relative frequency of characters is the same in the decrypted message, this type of encryption is highly vulnerable.*

**What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?**

>*Symmetric keys are shared by both sender and receiver. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys - typically one public key used by the sender to encrypt as well as a private key used by recipient to decrypt, although this can be done in reverse.*

**How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.**

>*TRNG rely on the observation of an unpredictable external source such as some stock market fund value and apply an algorithm. PRNGs appear random, but are just based on an algorithm and non-random seed value. They are potentially predictable with enough information.*

**Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.**
