## Reading Questions

**What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?**

>*Django is built using an MVT architecture (described more in the next question). Other built-in components include authentication, forms, admin, and ORM (for database interaction).*

**Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.**

>*The View is the hub of the MVT architecture. It receives requests received from the URL mapper, which itself handles and sorts requests received from the browser. Models manage database records (query, add, update, delete) through the View, while templates tell the View how to structure all of the data it receieves before sending a response.*

**What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?**

>*Tailwind allows for efficient application of CSS directly to html elements through built-in CSS classes. It is a lower level language than Bootstrap, which uses React Components. It is also much more customizable than bootstrap with the added benefit of limiting the size of CSS files.*

## Things I want to know more about

>*Does this mean I have to remember how to write html and CSS? :-P*
