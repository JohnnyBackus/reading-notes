## Reading Questions

**In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.**

>*The challenges are all related to sacrifices that may be necessary to handle the compressed course load. Personally, I already lost sleep and failed to exercise during 301. Two strategie to overcome the anticipated obstacled of 401 will be to prioritize going to the climbing gym three time per week as I find doing something active that I love necessary to muster the resilience needed to push through challenges. I'm also going to keep in mind that the worst thing that can happen to me is that I try and fail. There is value in that as well. As much as I would like to earn a living as a software dev, I'll still be ok if I find this isn't for me.*

**After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.**

>*Time and Space complexity are related topics described with Big O notation and are ways to describe resource allocation to run code - specifically time allocation and space/memory allocation.

**Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.**

>Mutable data types can be changed whereas immutable types cannot. Changing mutable types of data changes the reference value of all variables assigned to that data.*

## Things I want to know more about

>*I'm going to need to make a study table of Data Structures, common approached to algorithms, and Big O notation.*
