## Reading Questions

**In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.**

>*The challenges are all related to sacrifices that may be necessary to handle the compressed course load. Personally, I already lost sleep, ate poorly, and failed to exercise during 301. One strategy to overcome the anticipated obstacles of 401 will be to prioritize going to the climbing gym three time per week as I find doing something active that I love necessary to muster the resilience needed to push through challenges. The second strategy to employ will be hard cut-offs for homework. Even if the work doesn't get done, I need sleep, because once I fall behind on sleep, everything else gets more difficult, and I fall further behind.

**After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.**

>*Time and Space complexity are related topics described with Big O notation and are ways to describe resource allocation to run code - specifically time allocation and space/memory allocation.

**Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.**

>Mutable data types can be changed whereas immutable types cannot. Changing mutable types of data changes the reference value of all variables assigned to that data.*

## Things I want to know more about

>*I'm going to need to make a study table of Data Structures, common approached to algorithms, and Big O notation.*
