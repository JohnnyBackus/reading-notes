## Reading Questions

**What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?**

>*You can run your Jupyter Notebook within Jupyter Lab, but also have access to code consoles, terminals, as well as the ability to visualize other forms of data such as images and PDFs.*

**What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?**

>*NumPy allows for mathematical operations and manipulation of large data sets*

**Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.**

>*NumPy arrays can be visualized as lists of lists, but I think it's easier to think of them as a table. The first parameter when creating a NumPy array is a row. The second parameter (if used) references columns. Additional parameters can be used to provide more data depth and at each intersection of the prior parameters. To manipulate the data in a NumPy array, you can reference it with its parameters and execute built in methods such as mathematical operations or comparision operators.

## Things I want to know more about

>*I'd like find a cheatsheet I like to keep as a reference of the NumPy methods available.*
