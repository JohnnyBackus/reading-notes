>*Node behavior varies:*

- Nodes are to stacks, like Marshawn Lynch is to the gym: First in, Last out.
- Nodes are to queues, like Marshawn Lynch is to media day: Last in, First out.
- In stacks, you push or pop at the top.
- In queues.. well, it doesn't rhyme. You enqueue at the rear and dequeue at the front.
- In both case, you can take a peek or check isEmpty... and if you're at the bottom of a stack or the rear of a queue, your next is Null.
