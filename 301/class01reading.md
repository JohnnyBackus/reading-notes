## Component-Based Architecture

**What is a “component”?**

>*A reusable UI element such as tableOfContents composed of HTML, CSS, and JS code.

**What are the characteristics of a component?**

>*They are JS functions that return a snippet of structural code to help with breaking down your design into modular, reusable pieces. They must be capitalized to distinguish them from other JS functions.*

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

**What is “props” short for?**

>*Properties.. I think.*

**How are props used in React?**

**What is the flow of props?**

>*Child to Parent.*
