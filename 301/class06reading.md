Brief overview of how we communicate with servers.

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

If you’ve read this before, skim this article again for a refresher.

**To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?**

>*When I last worked at the bedside, I was on an exhausting unit with a patient population known for both being very ill and behaviorally difficult. Teamwork is expected on any hospital floor, but on that unit if ever I needed a hand, I always knew I could count on folks jumping to my aid if they were free. I don't doubt that our "what is said in the med room stays in the med room" unoffical policy as well as our breakroom "safe space" contributed to our camaraderie. We also had a manager who set a great example of being comfortable sharing vulnerable aspects of her personal life. I'm still in regular contact with more folks from that team than my current one even though I left four years ago.*

**How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?**

>*Psychological safety is valuable characteristic of a healthy workplace climate. I may ask potential future employers about their approach to psychological safety.*

## How I explained REST to my brother

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

>*One of the primary architects of HTTP*

**Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

>*We only talk to one server or group of servers at a time and they are not in communication with the rest of the machines out there.*

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

>*REST: Representational State Transfer*

**What does a GET do?**

>*Requests data.*

**What does a POST do?**

>*Creates a new resource.*

**What does PUT do?**

>Replaces an existing resource or creates a new one.*

**What does PATCH do?**

>*Updates a resource, but does not replace it entirely.*

## API Keys

Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
