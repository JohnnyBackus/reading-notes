# An Introduction to JavaScript

**What are variables in JavaScript?**

>*Variables are a shorthand way of representing (or containing/storing) a value.*

**What does it mean to `declare` a variable?**

>*To declare a variable is to name it; typically we assign a value at the same time... for example `let numberOfBears = 3`.*

**What is an `assignment` operator, and what does it do?**

>*The `assignment` operator in JavaScript is `=` and it assigns a value to a variable... like in the `let numberOfBears = 3` example above. In this example, whenever the variable `numberOfBears` is used in a line of code, you will get the same result as you would if you had '3'*
