# An Introduction to Operators and Loops

**What is an `expression` in JavaScript?**

>*An expression is a snippet of code that produces a value and if I understand correctly, is pretty much the most basic building block of code. Statements are composed of expressions.*

**Why would we use a loop in our code?**

>*Loops are concise ways of repeating an action until a condition is no longer met, which can save the programmer from writing countless lines of repeating code*

**When does a `for` loop stop executing?**

>*The `for` loop stops executing when the defined conditional is false.*

**How many times will a `while` loop execute?**

>*Similar to a `for` loop, `while` loop will execute until it's condition defined condiiton is no longer `true`*
