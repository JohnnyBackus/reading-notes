# 102 Lab 01B - Growth Mindset

_In my own words: A growth mindset[^1] is an outlook on life that is goal-oriented, which embraces challenges and relies on stoking resolve to overcome barriers to personal growth, development, and ultimately achievement._

## Some personal reminders to maintain a growth mindset:

1. Growth isn't easy, nor is it linear. Look back once in awhile and see how far you've come.
2. Learning new things enriches the soul and preserves the brain. Take care of yourself by challenging yourself.
3. Perseverence/Resolve/Willpower (whatev's I wanna call it). This is a skill that takes practice, too. The Growth Mindset may waiver, but that's ok. Just try again next time.
